## StarFigures
This program prints out a series of stars in a pattern.
To reduce redundancy, we can put re-occuring patterns in a static method and call it multiple times in the main method.
A small thing I realized when coding: you **must** put your static methods before your main method when you want to call the method.
Nothing is required to download for this code to run.
