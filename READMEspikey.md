This program prints out a series of backwards and forward slashes. 
It moves in a pattern of 2,4,6 and repeates itself once going in the opposite pattern.
Nothing is required to download for this code to run.
A small thing I realized when coding: since backslashes need to have two slashes to print one slash, you always need to have an even amount of slashes to print the correct amount fo slashes. You will know how many you have printed if you take your intial slashes and halve it. For example: six slashes would print three slashes. It is a very simple point, but it took me forever to realize.
